# File-Manager
A simple Python 3 application using Tkinter GUI Framework to demonstrate the basic CRUD operation on local files.

### Setup
To run this application the list of required dependencies are as follows:
- **Requests** *(optional)*
The requests module is required to get the login auth data from the online server. However its optional and can be bypassed in the login api.
- **Passlib**
Passlib module is used to encrypt the password field in each entry. This is also an experimental feature I added to try data encryption.

## GUI
Here are some previews of the GUI implemented.
